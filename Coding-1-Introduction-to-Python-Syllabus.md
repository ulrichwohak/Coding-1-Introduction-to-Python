## Background and overall aim

**Content.** This course introduces students to the basics of Python programming with a
focus on data handling, visualization, and foundational scripting. It is designed as a
beginner-level coding course specifically for students aiming to analyze and work with
data using Python. The course is built around interactive notebooks and real datasets,
enabling students to learn by doing.

**Relevance.** Python is de facto the lingua franca in data engineering, data science, and
data analytics. Most data solutions are deployed in production environments in Python, so
anyone looking for a position in the data world must be able to code in this language.

**Position in the sequence.** Coding 1 is the foundational course of the coding sequence.
Its purpose is to build the baseline programming literacy that every later course assumes:
reading code, writing it by hand, and reasoning about why it fails. Coding 2 (ECBS5306),
which follows in the same term, builds on this foundation and is where AI-assisted coding
is introduced. See the AI policy below.

## Course prerequisites

- Mathematics pre-session course.
- Students are expected to bring their own laptops to follow the coding classes.

No prior programming experience is assumed. Students should complete the environment setup
described in `lectures/lecture00-intro/setup.md` before or during Session 1.

## Waiting list handling

MS in Business Analytics students and MA in Economics, Data and Policy students have first
priority. All other students will be placed on the waiting list.

## Learning outcomes

**Key outcomes.** By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Write and debug basic Python programs.
- Use key data structures like lists and dictionaries.
- Read from and write to files.
- Work with structured datasets using pandas.
- Create visualizations using matplotlib and plotnine.
- Use loops, conditionals, and functions to automate tasks.
- Perform exploratory data analysis.

**Other outcomes.** The course will also help develop skills in the following areas:

- *Critical thinking* — reproduce errors and debug broken code.
- *Quantitative reasoning* — break down tasks into manageable components.
- *Technology skills* — learn Python's modelling tools and plotting libraries.
- *Interpersonal communication skills* — ability to interpret and communicate outputs.

**Supporting outcomes specific to this delivery.** Students will additionally be able to
work in a reproducible project environment managed by `uv`, use JupyterLab as a structured
environment for exploratory coding, construct reliable file paths with basic encoding
awareness, and handle common data-workflow failures with defensive coding and exceptions.

## Learning activities and teaching methods

The course will be conducted as a series of interactive lectures during which we go through
concepts and applications together. In addition, students will have in-class quizzes and a
graded in-class assignment at the end of each lecture.

Each session follows the same shape:

1. A short start-of-class quiz on the previous session (from Session 2 onward).
2. Live-coded walkthrough of the session's lecture notebook(s) from `lectures/`.
3. A 10-minute graded in-class assignment, completed and committed before you leave the
   room (from Session 2 onward).

All materials are distributed through the course repository. Students clone the repository,
create the environment with `uv sync`, download external datasets with
`uv run python scripts/fetch_data.py`, and work in JupyterLab. Students type their own code:
notebooks are worked through by hand, not by pasting completed solutions.

**Voluntary practice.** The repository also contains a set of short practice notebooks in
`exercises/`, one or two per lecture. These are optional, are not collected, and are not
graded. They exist purely so that you can rehearse the material at your own pace. Work
through them at home if you find them useful, and skip them if you do not.

The no-AI policy applies to them as it does to everything else in this course. They are
where you build the syntax recall that the closed-book exam tests, so they are precisely the
place where handing the work to a tool costs you most.

## Assessment

Grading will be based on the total score out of 100, in line with CEU Department of
Economics and Business grading guidelines. In particular:

a. The median student can expect to get a B+.
b. Probably not more than 1/3 of the students can expect to get an A or A−.
c. The passing grade is 50%.

The final grade is based on:

| Component | Weight | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start-of-the-class quiz | 20% | 5 quizzes at the start of Sessions 2–6, 4% each. Short, closed-book, on the previous session's material. |
| In-class assignments | 20% | 5 assignments, 4% each, at the end of Sessions 2–6. Completed and committed during class; nothing is done or submitted from home. |
| Closed-book final exam | 60% | Written, closed-book, no computer. Covers the whole course. **Friday, 6 November 2026 at 13:30.** The exam is separate from the six teaching sessions. |

### In-class assignments

The last ten minutes of each session from Session 2 onward are a short, graded assignment.
It asks you to *read* code rather than write it, which is the harder and more useful skill
at this stage.

**What you will do.** At the end of the lecture I publish a small assignment repository and
give you the link. You **fork** it to your own GitHub account, which gives you your own copy
to work in. It contains a README with the task and a single Python script, thirty or so
lines long, that uses the concepts we covered that day — and carries no comments at all. You
work through the script and add the comments yourself. Depending on the session, that means
one of:

- **Naming the mechanism.** Against each block, say which concept from the lecture it relies
  on and what it produces.
- **Predicting, then verifying.** Before running anything, write down the value you expect a
  line to produce. Commit that. Then run the script and, in a second commit, correct the
  predictions you got wrong. Being wrong costs you nothing here; not trying does.
- **Explaining a failure.** The script raises an error. On the offending line, say why.
  Do not fix it.
- **Documenting a function.** Write a docstring that states what the function takes, what it
  returns, and what it assumes.

Then you commit your work and push it to your fork before you leave the room. That is the
whole assignment. You do not need to send me anything: GitHub lists the forks of a
repository, so I collect them from there. Give me your GitHub username once, in Session 1,
and that is the last piece of admin you owe me. There is nothing to finish at home, nothing
to hand in later, and no deadline to track: it is done when the session ends.

You will not be marked on prose style, spelling, or how much you wrote. A good comment says
*why* a line exists or names the mechanism at work; a poor one restates the syntax. Marking
is coarse, out of two points:

- **2** — comments explain intent or name the mechanism at work.
- **1** — comments are present but restate the syntax (`# loop over the list`).
- **0** — no commit inside the class window, or no comments added.

Session 1 has no graded assignment. It is used instead to walk through the setup and the
submission workflow, so that the mechanics are not what costs you marks in Session 2.

From time to time I will ask someone to talk me through one of their own comments.

Because the final exam is closed-book and handwritten, the quizzes and these assignments
are deliberately designed to build recall and comprehension rather than reliance on lookup.

## AI policy

**The use of AI is not allowed in this course.**

This course is introductory, and we are mostly going to be learning a lot of basic syntax.
For that reason, the use of AI is not permitted for any part of the course: the
start-of-class quizzes, the in-class assignments, the final exam, and the voluntary practice
notebooks alike. You are expected to write your code by hand, read error messages yourself,
and work out what went wrong. That difficulty is the point — it is where the learning
happens, and the closed-book final exam is set on the assumption that you have done it.

The prohibition covers the voluntary practice notebooks even though they are never
collected. That is not an oversight. Those notebooks are your rehearsal for an exam you will
sit without a computer, and they are the one place where the cost of using a tool falls
entirely on you.

I define "AI" here as LLM and other machine learning methods including ChatGPT, GitHub
Copilot, Bard, Claude, Grammarly, DeepL, and any other available tools. This includes
AI-completion features built into editors: if you use VS Code, disable Copilot and any
inline AI suggestions for your course work.

**This policy is specific to Coding 1, and it changes in the next course.** Coding 2
(ECBS5306) permits AI as an assistant that helps you code and debug faster, rather than as a
substitute for doing the work. The reason for the order is straightforward: you can only
judge whether an AI-generated solution is correct, efficient, or appropriate if you can
already read and write the code yourself. Coding 1 builds that judgment; Coding 2 puts it to
use.

What is permitted in Coding 1: the official documentation for Python, pandas, plotnine, and
matplotlib; the course notebooks; textbooks and course notes; and discussing concepts with
classmates. What is not permitted: generating, completing, translating, or explaining code
with an AI tool.

## Course contents

The course runs over six 100-minute sessions. Lecture material lives in `lectures/`. Each
session ends with a graded in-class assignment from Session 2 onward. The voluntary
practice notebooks listed under each session are optional homework: work through them if you
find them useful, but they are never collected. The two blocks below follow the study
guide's grouping, with one adjustment: plotting is delivered at the start of the second
block rather than the end of the first, so that pandas has a full session of its own.

### Sessions 1–3

**Session 1 — 16 September · Setup and general coding principles**

- Python, JupyterLab, and VS Code; the `uv`-managed project environment; running a script
  from the console.
- Version control: what Git and GitHub are for, why tracking changes matters, and where
  they sit in a working data project. This is an overview, not a Git course — you will learn
  the tool properly later in the program. What we do cover in full is the one workflow you
  need here: fork the assignment repository, edit it, commit, push. Every in-class assignment
  from Session 2 onward is handed in that way, so we walk through it end to end and make sure
  it works on your laptop before you are graded on it. Bring a GitHub account, or create one
  in this session.
- General coding principles: how to name variables, why and how to comment scripts.
- Variables, assignment, and the primitive types (integers, floats, booleans); expressions
  and operators; string manipulation and formatting.
- Materials: `lectures/lecture00-intro`, `lectures/lecture01-coding-basics`.
- Voluntary practice: `exercises/lecture01-coding-basics-i.ipynb`,
  `exercises/lecture01-coding-basics-ii.ipynb`.
- **No graded assignment.** The session closes with a walkthrough of the submission
  workflow and a first practice commit, so the mechanics are settled before they carry
  marks.

**Session 2 — 23 September · Basic data structures and file I/O**

- The four Python collections: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries. Inspecting, searching,
  modifying, and iterating; set operations; casting between collection types.
- JSON strings to dictionaries and back.
- Opening files for reading, reading text line by line, handling encodings; writing,
  appending, and overwriting; working directories, listing files, OS-specific paths,
  creating directories.
- Materials: `lectures/lecture02-basic-structures`, `lectures/lecture03-data-IO`.
- Voluntary practice: `exercises/lecture02-basic-structures-i.ipynb` through
  `exercises/lecture03-data-io-ii.ipynb`.
- **In-class assignment (10 min):** predict-then-verify. Read a short script using variables,
  a dictionary lookup, and simple arithmetic. Comment the code, predict its two printed
  values, commit, then run and correct any wrong prediction.

**Session 3 — 30 September · Data containers: pandas**

- Creating `Series` and `DataFrame`s from series, dictionaries, and lists; access with `loc`
  and `iloc`; resetting the index; renaming columns; reading DataFrame metadata.
- Data munging: adding variables, splitting a character variable, type conversion, string
  methods on Series, filtering and tabulating values, missing values, replacing values,
  handling duplicates, chaining operations, and sorting.
- Data: hotels-vienna, hotels-europe.
- Materials: `lectures/lecture04-pandas-basics`.
- Voluntary practice: `exercises/lecture04-pandas-basics-i.ipynb` through
  `exercises/lecture04-pandas-munging-ii.ipynb`.
- **In-class assignment (10 min):** name the concept. Comment each step of an uncommented
  pandas munging pipeline with the operation it performs and why.

### Sessions 4–6

**Session 4 — 7 October · Control flow and plotting**

- Conditionals and control flow: the anatomy of `if`/`else`, `for` loops, `while` loops, and
  list comprehensions.
- Plotting with matplotlib first: the `Figure` and `Axes` objects, axis limits, legends, log scales, a
  second axis, bar spacing and grids, charts within charts. Students meet the explicit,
  step-by-step plotting model before any higher-level abstraction, so that they know what a
  figure is actually made of.
- plotnine and the grammar of graphics, introduced second as a more compact way to express
  the same ideas: `geoms`, continuous and discrete scales, limits and break points,
  annotation with lines, points and text; bar charts (simple, stacked, percentage), box
  plots, violin plots, colour values.
- Materials: `lectures/lecture05-conditionals`, `lectures/lecture06-graphs-basics`.
- Voluntary practice, in this order: `exercises/lecture05-control-flow-i.ipynb`,
  `exercises/lecture05-control-flow-ii.ipynb`, `exercises/lecture06-matplotlib.ipynb`,
  `exercises/lecture06-plotnine-i.ipynb`, `exercises/lecture06-plotnine-ii.ipynb`.
- **In-class assignment (10 min):** annotate a loop with the state of its variables, and
  comment a figure script layer by layer, saying what each call adds.

**Session 5 — 14 October · Functions, exception handling, and descriptive statistics**

- User-defined functions: structure, arguments, return values, docstrings, `help`, `lambda`
  functions, and refactoring repeated code into reusable helpers.
- Exception handling: `try` and `except`, identifying exception types, and selecting actions
  based on the type of error encountered.
- Data exploration, part 1: `describe` and `skim` for quick summaries; means, medians,
  standard deviations, percentiles, counts of missing values; grouped descriptives with
  `groupby` and `agg`; histograms and kernel densities, and the role of bin width and
  bandwidth.
- Materials: `lectures/lecture08-functions`, `lectures/lecture09-exception-handling`,
  `lectures/lecture07-data-exploration` (first part).
- Voluntary practice: `exercises/lecture08-functions-i.ipynb`,
  `exercises/lecture08-functions-ii.ipynb`, `exercises/lecture09-exceptions.ipynb`,
  `exercises/lecture07-data-exploration-i.ipynb`.
- **In-class assignment (10 min):** write a docstring for each of three functions, and explain
  on the offending line why a given script raises its exception. Do not fix it.

**Session 6 — 21 October · Association, hypothesis tests, and wrap-up**

- Data exploration, part 2: hypothesis testing with t-tests (two-sided and one-sided,
  and across groups); association between two variables with `cov` and `corr`; scatter
  plots; bin-scatters with equidistant bins and with equal numbers of observations per bin;
  correlations within subgroups.
- Course review and preparation for the closed-book final exam.
- *Optional, time permitting* — a preview of Coding 2: introduction to regression with
  binary means, binscatter, lowess, and a simple linear regression estimated with
  `statsmodels`, including predictions, residuals, and identifying the best and worst hotel
  deals. This material is not examinable in Coding 1.
- Materials: `lectures/lecture07-data-exploration` (second part), and optionally
  `lectures/lecture10-intro-to-regression`.
- Voluntary practice: `exercises/lecture07-data-exploration-ii.ipynb`, and optionally
  `exercises/lecture10-regression-i.ipynb`, `exercises/lecture10-regression-ii.ipynb`.
- **In-class assignment (10 min):** name the concept over a correlation and bin-scatter script.

## Software and course materials

The course uses Python 3.12 with an environment managed by `uv`. After cloning the
repository:

```bash
uv sync
uv run python scripts/fetch_data.py
uv run jupyter lab
```

Do not use `pip`, `pipenv`, or `%pip`/`!pip` inside notebooks to manage the course
environment; `uv` is the only supported workflow, and the repository's checks enforce this.

Core packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `plotnine`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `statsmodels`,
`skimpy`, `stargazer`, `jupyterlab`.

Datasets are not stored in the repository. `scripts/fetch_data.py` downloads them into
`data/raw/`: hotels-vienna, hotels-europe (prices and features), sp500, and billion-prices.
Sources are documented in `data/README.md`.

## Readings and further material

There is no required textbook. The following are supplementary and optional:

- Békés, G. and Kézdi, G., *Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy* — the source
  of the datasets and case studies used throughout the course.
- Turrell, A., *Coding for Economists* — a useful companion for data exploration.
- The official documentation for Python, pandas, plotnine, and matplotlib. Learning to read
  documentation is itself a course objective.

Individual lecture READMEs list further material specific to each topic.
