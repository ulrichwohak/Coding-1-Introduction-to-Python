# Coding 1 2026 Session Plan

**ECBS5208 Coding 1: Introduction to Python**, Fall term 2026-2027.

Six sessions, Wednesdays 15:40-17:20 (100 minutes), 16 September to 21 October 2026. Dates
and times are taken from the TimeEdit allocation for `ECBS5208A_T1_2026`, Group A. Room TBC.

There is no reading week inside the course: the six sessions run on six consecutive
Wednesdays. The final exam takes place on **Friday, 6 November 2026 at 13:30**,
separately from the six teaching sessions.

## Open tasks

- **No assessment materials exist yet.** The grading scheme requires 5 quizzes (20%), 5
  in-class assignment repositories (20%), and a closed-book final (60%). None are written.
- **Five template repositories to build**, one per graded session. Each holds a README with
  the task, a 25-40 line uncommented `.py` script using that session's concepts, and a
  rubric. Use `.py` rather than `.ipynb`: a comment-only change to a notebook produces an
  unreadable JSON diff, whereas in a script `git diff` shows exactly the added lines, so
  grading is reading a diff.
- **Distribution is fork-based.** One assignment repository per graded session, published
  at the end of the lecture; students fork it, commit to their fork, and push. Nothing is
  emailed: GitHub lists a repository's forks, so collection is just enumerating them
  (`gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/forks`), and each fork's compare view against the source shows
  exactly the lines a student added. Collect GitHub usernames in Session 1 to map forks to
  the roster.
- **Forks of a public repository are public.** This is the weak point of the scheme, and it
  is not AI: every student works on the same script, so a late forker can read an earlier
  one's comments. The 10-minute in-class window limits it, but does not close it. Options,
  cheapest first: rely on the window plus the occasional oral spot-check; vary the script
  across two or three variants per session; or make the source repository private and add
  students as collaborators, so forks inherit private visibility, at the cost of managing
  access each session.
- **Git is not taught here, but the submission workflow is.** Students learn Git properly in
  a later course. Session 1 gives an overview of version control and then covers the one
  workflow needed for the in-class assignments end to end: take the link, get the
  repository, edit, commit, push. Getting GitHub authentication working on every laptop is
  the part that will eat the clock. Keep a browser-based fallback ready - editing and
  committing in the GitHub web UI needs no local setup at all - in case the room runs short
  or a student's machine will not cooperate.
- **AI policy is blanket, matching the study guide.** No AI anywhere in the course,
  including the voluntary practice notebooks, even though those are never collected and use
  cannot be verified. The syllabus states the rationale rather than the enforcement.
- **Registrar wording.** The study guide calls the 20% component "Homework submissions".
  The syllabus now calls it "In-class assignments", since nothing is done or submitted from
  home. The weight is unchanged; the label may want aligning with the registrar.

## Notes

- **Exercise filenames follow the lecture, not the session.** Exercises are named
  `lectureNN-topic.ipynb`, matching the `lectures/lectureNN-*` directory they practise.
  Sessions bundle several lectures, so one session draws on several prefixes; use the table
  above to see which. This decoupling is deliberate: session packing may change, but an
  exercise always belongs to its lecture.
- **Session 4 order.** Conditionals and control flow are taught before plotting. Within
  plotting, matplotlib is taught before plotnine so students see the explicit
  `Figure`/`Axes` model before the grammar-of-graphics abstraction.
- **Session 5 splits `lecture07`.** The natural breakpoints in that lecture are
  hypothesis-testing and association; part 1 stops before hypothesis testing.
- **Regression is optional** and not examinable in Coding 1. It previews Coding 2
  (ECBS5306).
- **SQL is not taught in this course.** `lectures/lecture01-coding-basics/README.md`,
  `lectures/lecture02-basic-structures/`, and `exercises/lecture01-coding-basics-ii.ipynb`
  still contain SQL string-building examples inherited from the upstream material; they are
  not part of the syllabus.
